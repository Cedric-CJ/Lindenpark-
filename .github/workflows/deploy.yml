      # NOTE: This workflow assumes you have a standard build setup (e.g., Vite, Create React App).
      # You will need to add a `package.json` with dependencies and a `build` script.
      # For example:
      # 1. npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react
      # 2. Add a `vite.config.ts` and a `build` script in `package.json`: "build": "vite build"
      # 3. Ensure your vite.config.ts has the correct `base` path for GitHub Pages.
